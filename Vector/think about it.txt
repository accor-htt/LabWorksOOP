be aware of yourself without judgement “. This is the key. The moment you judge, (or make any comment), you’ve lost the simple awareness. Awareness, or consciousness, is the Way.

Why is that? I think we can get too excited about making a change or doing new things. When we dream about making a change in our lives and start believing in it, the excitement usually takes over.

Always remind yourself that you want to stay fired up

When you start something new, it’s not about your results. When I started writing every day, I couldn’t care less about how many words I wrote. Or when I started getting daily exercise, I didn’t care what type of exercise. I just wanted to make sure I did it.

Wrote for 4 minutes? Great — you did it.
Went for a 20-minute walk? Great — you did it.
Read a book for 2 minutes? Great — you did it.

So instead of focusing on the BIG outcome, focus on the SMALL start.
Look at what you want to achieve in your life. Then, look at what habits will make that happen.

And remember: Habits are not about results.

No one cares about how many pages you’ve read, how hard you’ve worked out, or how long you haven’t smoked a cigarette. You should only care about what you did today — and don’t focus on metrics.

Life is a competition with yourself — not others. And if you want to win, you must make it easy for yourself.

I use 50% of the time to do the difficult tasks, studying the basics, concepts, algorithms and such. The other 50% of the time I am doing my own projects, projects I am really passionate about. So that there is a balance when it comes to my day-to-day study.
